- Topic in kafka has 3 partitions.
- Offset is like id = partition 1 offset 2, means 2nd element in partition 1.
- Order is guaranteed only within a partition (not across partitions).
- Data is kept for some time, default is one week.
- Data is immutable, once written can't be changed.
- Data is assigned randomly to a partition unless a key is provided.
